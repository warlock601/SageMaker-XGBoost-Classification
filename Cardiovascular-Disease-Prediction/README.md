Height | Objective Feature | height | int (cm) |
Weight | Objective Feature | weight | float (kg) |
Gender | Objective Feature | gender | categorical code |
Systolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_hi | int |
Diastolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_lo | int |
Cholesterol | Examination Feature | cholesterol | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
Glucose | Examination Feature | gluc | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
Smoking | Subjective Feature | smoke | binary |
Alcohol intake | Subjective Feature | alco | binary |
Physical activity | Subjective Feature | active | binary |
Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | Target Variable | cardio | binary |

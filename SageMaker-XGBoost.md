# SageMaker XGBoost
- XGBoost or Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm is one of the most famous and powerful algorithms to perform both regression and classification tasks. 
- XGBoost is a supervised learning algorithm and implements gradient boosted trees algorithm. 
- The algorithm work by combining an ensemble of predictions from several weak models.

Combining a majority vote out of all different trees will generate a more robust prediction compared to only using one single tree. 

### Why does Xgboost work really well? 
- Since the technique is an ensemble algorithm, it is very robust and could work well with several data types and complex distributions. 
- Xgboost has a many tunable hyperparameters that could improve model fitting.

### What are the applications of XGBoost?
XGBoost could be used for fraud detection to detect the probability of a fraudulent transactions based on transaction features.

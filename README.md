# SageMaker-XGBoost-Classification
This repository demonstrates the usage of Amazon SageMaker's XGBoost algorithm to perform classification tasks.


## Principal Component Analysis
PCA is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that performs dimensionality reductions while attempting at keeping the original information unchanged. PCA works by trying to find a new set of features called components.
Components are composites of the uncorrelated given input features. </br>
In Amazon SageMaker PCA operates in two modes:
- Regular: works well with sparse data small (manageable) number of observations/features.
- Randomized: works well with large number of observations/features.

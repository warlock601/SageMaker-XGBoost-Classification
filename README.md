# SageMaker-XGBoost-Classification
This repository demonstrates the usage of Amazon SageMaker's XGBoost algorithm to perform classification tasks.


## Project Overview
Aim of the problem is to detect the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in person based on the given features. </br>
Features available are:
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Gender
- Smoking
- Alcohol intake
- Physical activity
- Systolic blood pressure
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Glucose


### Blood Pressure
- Blood pressure is represented by 2 numbers systolic and diastolic (ideally 120/80 mm Hg). These two number are critical in assessing the heart health.
- The top number represents systolic and the bottom number representing the diastolic.
- Systolic pressure indicates the blood pressure in the arteries when the blood is pumped out of the heart.
- The diastolic pressure indicates the blood pressure between beats (at rest, filling up and ready to pump again).
- If these numbers are high, that means that the heart is exerting more effort to pump blood in the arteries to the body.

### Cholesterol
- Cholesterol is a waxy material found in humans blood. Normal level of cholesterol is necessary to ensure healthy body cells but as these levels increase, heart disease risk is elevated.
- This waxy material can block the arteries and could result in strokes and heart attacks.
- Healthy lifestyle and regular exercises can reduce the risk of having high cholesterol levels.
